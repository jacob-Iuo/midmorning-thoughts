Welcome to the sprawling canvas of Jacob's midmorning thoughts. It is currently 6:04 am, 1/9/2023. 

Ben Meer is crazy. No idea who he really is, but I really respect his communication style on twitter. I see a ton of lifestyle advice everywhere. Ben just hits differently!

I learned today that Einstein, Thatcher, and Da Vinci all share a lifestyle trait in common. They sleep! Alot. Or at least, frequently nap to the point of routine. 

Why is this so cool? Well, I nap too so I am a little biased. But the thought here is that these three briliant minds: theoretical physicist, enigmatic writer, and predecessor of Tony Stark. They all were creatives. Thinkers, builders, and artists.

I aspire to be a real world tony stark. In a spiderman suit. And a key step to building the spider suit is adapting my lifestyle to something that helps inspire creativity: naps.
