Broad education reform
These mornings, I usually journal or think. I journal with my eyes closed. I talk to my dad. Love you dad.

Today, I will submit my second series of mid-morning thoughts. The sun is still down and the air is wet. Stuck inside, I contemplate: wtf just happened last night?

Last night, I got fucked. Not the fun type of fucked. And I proceeded to attend one of the most transformational events of my li- my week. LatchBio hosted a great event with Nucleate. It was fun, the burritos were fantastic, and I loved the conversations I had when people finally gave up on networking.

Last night, I met a mathematician. Let's call him Nigma, like enigma but rhymes more closely to ligma. Nigma is not such a great choice of words. Let's call him smigma, like smegma without all the rest.

Last night I met smegma. He was great and didn't smell like the rest of them. Instead, he spoke with a clarity like none other. We spoke of many things, and education reform + AI safety was among them.

Dans that conversation, I learned 3 things, among others. The top 3 on my mind right now:

1. Education reform really does start at the very beginning, with a child's psycho/social development
2. Cheating needs new positive incentives. Yes, rewarding cheaters. Or more accurately, rewarding creative paths to meet the demands of challenges.
3. ChatGPT is more than a cheat engine. It's even more than a secondary research tool. It is a conversationalist, a robot buddy, and a pen pal. 

If packaged into the right product, this could do wonders for education. My little brother - enegma - does a ton of learning simply by asking questions and using the internet. ChatGPT could be a vessel for this curiousity, and ship passionate young minds into the future. The myopic pessimist in me is worried sick about the cheating infested future. But the rational optimist in me is excited to see the birth of the next Leonardi da Vinci.
